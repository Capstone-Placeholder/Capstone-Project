## About the Project
What is the target variable? Popularity

### Goals
- Build a dataset of songs using Spotify's API
- Identify the drivers of song popularity
- Create a regression model to predict how popular a song will be that has an RMSE lower than the baseline

### Background
What makes a song popular? According to Splinter News [here](https://splinternews.com/how-does-a-song-become-number-one-1793850261),
> "making a 'good' number one song is not necessarily the same as making a 'good' song in general. It's not about artistry (though 
> sometimes artistry does hit number one). It's about popularity. And not long-term popularity. But popularity right here, right now."  

By analyzing Spotify's API data, we will determine ourselves what influences a song's popularity.
